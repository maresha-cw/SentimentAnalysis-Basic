# SentimentAnalysis-DataAnalysisFinal
Sentiment Analysis using TensorFlow for Final Project Data Analysis Course

Three Code files:
- Sentiment Analysis Basic (Inspired by https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification)
- Sentiment Analysis with RNN (Inspired by https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_classification_rnn)
- Visualisation of the Dataset and the prediction result (using WordCloud, Matplotlib, Pyplot)

Created by: Maresha C Wijanto (211AIG05) and Cici Suhaeni (211AIG02)

Dataset:
- For Training and Validation: Sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive). Created by Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang, who were Computer Science graduate students at Stanford University.
- For Testing: Covid-19 All Vaccines Tweets (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/all-covid19-vaccines-tweets). The data is collected using tweepy Python package to access Twitter API. Used relevant search term (most frequently used in Twitter to refer to the respective vaccine) for each of the vaccine.
The Dataset was too large to share here (Sentiment140 dataset 227MB and Covid-19 All Vaccines Tweets 76.3MB).
So here we attached the link to access the dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-gJ6ioFDJBkVVezW-5ugxs3-j37JF7Dy?usp=sharing (can only accessed for students of Data Analysis course)

Step by Step Solutions:
