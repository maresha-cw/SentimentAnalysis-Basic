- Sentiment Analysis with RNN (Inspired by https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_classification_rnn)

Created by: Maresha C Wijanto and Cici Suhaeni

Dataset:
- For Training and Validation: Sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive). Created by Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang, who were Computer Science graduate students at Stanford University.
- For Testing: Covid-19 All Vaccines Tweets (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/all-covid19-vaccines-tweets). The data is collected using tweepy Python package to access Twitter API. Used relevant search term (most frequently used in Twitter to refer to the respective vaccine) for each of the vaccine.

Step by Step Solutions:
- Preprocessing Data (include: Split and Encode Data)
- Creating Model
- Evaluating Model
- Testing
